# Analysis of Machine Learning Classification Models on Sales Datasets
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze the performance of various machine learning classification models on different sales datasets. The performance of these models will be evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This analysis will help in understanding the effectiveness of different models in predicting sales-related outcomes.

## Objectives
To preprocess and clean multiple sales datasets available in CSV format.
To apply different machine learning classification models to these datasets.
To evaluate and compare the models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
To identify the most suitable model for predicting sales outcomes based on the evaluation metrics.
## Methodology
### Data Collection
Datasets: Multiple sales datasets in CSV format will be collected. These datasets contain various sales-related features and target variables for classification.
### Data Preprocessing
Loading Data: Read the CSV files into pandas DataFrames.
Cleaning Data: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and preprocess the data to convert categorical variables into numerical formats if necessary.
Feature Selection: Select relevant features for model training.
Data Splitting: Split the datasets into training and testing sets.
### Model Training
#### Machine Learning Models:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

#### Training: Train each model on the training set.

### Model Evaluation
#### Metrics: Evaluate the performance of each model using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in the actual class.
F1 Score: The weighted average of Precision and Recall.
Calculation: Use the testing set to calculate the metrics for each model.

### Results and Analysis
Comparison: Compare the performance of the models based on the evaluation metrics.
Visualization: Visualize the results using plots to provide a clear comparison.
Selection: Identify the best-performing model for each dataset.
