# Analysis of Machine Learning Classification Models on Sales Datasets
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze the performance of various machine learning classification models on different sales datasets. The performance of these models will be evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This analysis will help in understanding the effectiveness of different models in predicting sales-related outcomes.

Objectives
To preprocess and clean multiple sales datasets available in CSV format.
To apply different machine learning classification models to these datasets.
To evaluate and compare the models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
To identify the most suitable model for predicting sales outcomes based on the evaluation metrics.
